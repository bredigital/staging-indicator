Displays information in the header of WordPress admin when logged in, to help identify which system you are using. The menu item will also drop down a site switcher to enable fast switching between stages.

To change the displayed values, edit the `config.env` file. This plugin adds support for the plugin editor to edit `.env`, so you can edit it directly from WordPress.
